# Chat Platform

The compiler team hangs out in [the rust-lang Zulip][z] these days.

Feel free to introduce yourself and say hi in the [`#new-members`](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/122652-new-members) stream!

The [`#t-compiler/help`](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/182449-t-compiler.2Fhelp) stream is also a great place to ask questions. 

In addition, each working group has one or more streams where they communicate.
